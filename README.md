# Model Building
First, I Stadarized the Data . I also split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.

I tried two different models 
 * KNN 
 * Random Forest â€“ Again, with the sparsity associated with the data, I thought that this would be a good fit.

# Model performance
 * Random Forest : score = 98%
 * Knn : score = 73%
